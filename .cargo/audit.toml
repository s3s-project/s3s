[advisories]
# Ignored advisories with reasons:
# RUSTSEC-2025-0134: Transitive dependency 'rustls-pemfile' is marked
# unmaintained; accepted temporarily due to upstream dependency chain
# (hyper-rustls via aws-smithy). Re-evaluate and remove when aws-* deps
# update or the advisory is resolved upstream.
# RUSTSEC-2026-0002: Transitive dependency 'lru' has unsound IterMut
# implementation that violates Stacked Borrows; accepted temporarily
# due to upstream dependency chain (aws-sdk-s3). Re-evaluate and remove
# when aws-sdk-s3 updates or the advisory is resolved upstream.
